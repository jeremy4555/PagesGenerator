# Function
From [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html):
This is the loss function used in (multinomial) logistic regression and extensions of it such as neural networks, defined as the negative log-likelihood of the true labels given a probabilistic classifier’s predictions. The log loss is only defined for two or more labels. For a single sample with true label yt in {0,1} and estimated probability yp that yt = 1, the log loss is
$$-log P(yt|yp) = -(yt\ log(yp) + (1 - yt) log(1 - yp))$$<!--more-->

However, the actual scroe of 'is_duplicate' equals 1 or 0, we can derive from this function into
$$-log P(yt|yp) = -(log(yp) + log(1 - yp))$$


# Source data
Because of the copy right issue, I give you part of the data. Originally, the dataset contains  6 columns: id, qid1, qid2, question1, question2, is_duplicate, which is used to train a model to distinguish whether two questions are duplicate. 

|id|qid1|qid2|question1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|question2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|is_duplicate|
|--|--|--|--------|--------|--------|
|$0$|	1|	2|	What is the step by step...|	What is the step by step guide to invest in sh...|	0|
|$1$|	3|	4|	What is the story of...|	What would happen if the Indian government sto...|	0|
|$2$|	5|	6|	How can I increase the speed...|	How can Internet speed be increased by hacking...|	0|


However, we don't need actul text in questions in order to learn LogLoss function. Aa a result, I delete 'question1', 'question2', and release this edition: {% asset_link train.csv trainingData %}


|id|	qid1|	qid2|	is_duplicate|
|--|--------|--------|--------|
|0|	1|	2|	0|
|1|	3|	4|	0|
|2|	5|	6|	0|

# Code

1. Self-Defined LogLoss
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
path = 'path/to/train.csv'
df_train = pd.read_csv(path)
df_train.head()

def logloss(actual, predict):
    predict = min(max(predict, 1e-15), (1 - (1e-15)))  
    ##if the number smaller than 10^-15, then define it to be 10^-15
    ##if the number bigger than 1-(10^-15), then define it to be 1-(10^-15)
    
    if actual == 1:    ##actual==1, else(actual==0)
        return np.log(predict)    ##numpy default log == ln (with e as base)
    else:
        return np.log(1-predict)
    
predict = np.average(df_train['is_duplicate'])    
##Assume our model predict every query pair has a score of average score of all pairs
print(predict)
LoglossList = [-logloss(actual, predict) for actual in df_train['is_duplicate']]
LoglossScore = np.average(LoglossList)
print(LoglossScore)
```

2. Use sklearn
```python
from sklearn.metrics import log_loss

p = np.average(df_train['is_duplicate'])    ##directly use average score
print(p)
LoglossScore = log_loss(df_train['is_duplicate'], np.zeros_like(df_train['is_duplicate']) + p)
print(LoglossScore)
```
